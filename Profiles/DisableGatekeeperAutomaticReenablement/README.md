On OS X 10.10.x and later, disabling Gatekeeper does not mean it is permanently off. After a set amount of time (currently 30 days), Gatekeeper will automatically re-enable itself with the **Allow apps downloaded from: Mac App Store and identified developers** setting.

This OS X management profile sets Gatekeeper's automatic re-enablement function to be disabled, enabling Gatekeeper to be set to **Allow apps downloaded from: Anywhere** and have it stay that way.
