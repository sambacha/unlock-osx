This macOS management profile sets the desktop background to the image specified in the `override-picture-path` setting.

**Note:** The locked setting value isn't actually respected. If the locked setting is present and set as `false`, the desktop picture will still be locked and cannot be changed from the image specified in the `override-picture-path` setting..
