This management profile enables the **Automatically Download and Install** option in Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) 3.8 and later. This option enables MAU 3.8 and later to automatically download updates for Office 2016 applications and perform the following actions:

* If an Office 2016 application is not running - MAU will automatically install the update for the application

* If an Office application is running - MAU will prompt the customer and give them the option of updating later or restarting the application. If the customer chooses to restart their application, the application will be closed, updated and then re-opened.
