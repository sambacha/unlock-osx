# This script is a modified version of rtrouton's re-enable_java_6_and_7 script.
# This script will check the current Adobe Flash browser plug-in
# version and compare it against the minimum version allowed by
# Apple's XProtect malware protection. If the minimum Flash version 
# allowed by XProtect does not allow the current version of the Flash
# browser plug-in on the Mac, the script will alter the Mac's 
# /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/XProtect.meta.plist 
# file to set the minimum version allowed to match the current version
# of the Mac's Flash browser plug-in. This allows the Mac's current Flash
# browser plug-in to run in Safari without being blocked.
#
# Original script is from here:
# https://gist.github.com/scifiman/5109047

# Check to see if Xprotect is blocking Adobe's Flash browser plug-in and re-enable the plug-in if needed.
